## 2022 Freshwater Probabilistic Monitoring Chapter

Coauthored by Jason Hill, Emma Jones, and Lucy Baker. 

Major updates to this cycle report involve codifying the data acquisition process. This component streamlines the entire chapter reporting process into the R environment. Previously, R did not have access to the ODS environment, requiring all data querying and initial cleaning to be performed in Logi/Excel. By moving the data querying, manipulation, and QA process into R, the reproducibility as well as time required to generate report will be improved

A ProjectOverview.Rmd is provided to walk users through the entire project, sourcing additional .Rmd's and scripts as necessary to aid in project organization. 

## R Version

The 2022 IR analyses and chapter is produced using R3.6.2 to maintain seamless interoperability with the R Connect server. The spsurvey updates will be incorporated in the IR 2024 chapter.
