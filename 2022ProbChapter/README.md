## 2022 Freshwater Probabilistic Monitoring Chapter

Coauthored by Jason Hill, Emma Jones, and Lucy Baker. 

## Project Updates 

Major updates to this cycle report involve codifying the data acquisition process. This component streamlines the entire chapter reporting process into the R environment. Previously, R did not have access to the ODS environment, requiring all data querying and initial cleaning to be performed in Logi/Excel. By moving the data querying, manipulation, and QA process into R, the reproducibility as well as time required to generate report will be improved

A ProjectOverview.Rmd is provided to walk users through the entire project, sourcing additional .Rmd's and scripts as necessary to aid in project organization. 

## R Version

The 2022 IR analyses and chapter are produced using R 3.6.1 to maintain seamless interoperability with the R Connect server. The spsurvey updates will be incorporated in the IR 2024 chapter.
