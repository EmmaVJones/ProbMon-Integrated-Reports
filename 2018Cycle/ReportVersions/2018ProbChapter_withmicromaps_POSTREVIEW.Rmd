## Chapter 2.4 FRESHWATER PROBABILISTIC MONITORING

### 2.4.1 Executive Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProbMon is designed to answer questions about statewide and regional water quality conditions through the use of a statistically valid sample frame across large geographic areas. The VDEQ Probabilistic Monitoring Program, or ProbMon, has sampled `r nrow(surveyData)` wadeable sites statewide since the program began in 2001 (Figure 2.4-5). Over `r signif(nrow(filter(designStatus,IR2018 == '2018')),digits=2)` sites were sampled during the `r IRyear` assessment period (Figure 2.4-2). Although the majority of water quality parameters meet applicable water quality criteria, the biological condition of Virginia streams fail to meet expectations in approximately `r format(filter(paramsummary, Parameter=='VSCI/VCPMI\n(Biomonitoring)')$pct,digits=1)`% of stream miles (Figure 2.4-1). Biological condition is assessed using aquatic organisms as indicators of stream health. These biological impairments are believed to be caused in part by stressors that are not subject to water quality criteria such as streambed sedimentation, habitat disturbance, and nutrients. The most frequently occurring water quality problems are presented in Figure 2.4-1. ProbMon is a cost-effective way to evaluate Virginia streams and rivers, test new sampling methods, and support other VDEQ water quality management activities like water quality standards development, Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) studies, and setting more defensible permit conditions. The survey design, analysis, and geovisualization of ProbMon data uses open source software, which promotes the scientific transparency and reproducibility of this monitoring program. All data and analysis scripts can be accessed at : https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Programs/Water/WaterQualityInformationTMDLs/WaterQualityMonitoring/ProbabilisticMonitoring/ProbMonDataSources.aspx .

### 2.4.2 Introduction	

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probabilistic monitoring is designed to answer basic questions like: “What are the primary water quality problems in Virginia? How widespread are these problems, and what pollutants cause the greatest environmental stress to Virginia’s water resources?” The Virginia General Assembly, citizens, environmental stakeholders, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have encouraged the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) to answer these questions and to establish baseline water quality conditions for Virginia’s streams and rivers. ProbMon is one component of VDEQ’s Water Quality Monitoring Strategy. Typically water quality monitoring stations are located at bridges, boat ramps or other public access points.  These monitoring stations are known as targeted monitoring sites. Targeted monitoring has great utility for identifying impaired waters, supporting TMDL and Implementation Plan modeling efforts, monitoring water quality trends over time, tracking local pollution events, and monitoring regulatory compliance of pollution sources. However, it is not appropriate to extrapolate results from targeted stations to un-sampled watersheds over large geographic areas. Data to address water quality questions from large geographic areas are best obtained from statistically designed studies with randomly chosen sample locations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Virginia, ProbMon sites are randomly selected using USEPA’s probability survey design program (Stevens 1997; USEPA 2006; Kincaid & Olsen 2016; R Core Team 2017). From 2001 to `r IRyearWindowEnd`, VDEQ has evaluated over `r signif(nrow(designStatus),digits=3)` stations and sampled `r nrow(surveyData)` sites (Figure 2.4-5). In some cases, stations were evaluated, but not sampled for a variety of reasons including: the stream was not perennial, it was saltwater influenced, or the landowner denied access. VDEQ samples 50 to 60 random stations per year throughout Virginia for a variety of chemical, biological, and habitat parameters.  From January 1st, 2011 until December 31st, `r IRyearWindowEnd` VDEQ evaluated 444 sites and sampled `r nrow(filter(designStatus,IR2018 == '2018'))` stations (Figure 2.4-2). Figures 2.4-3 and 2.4-4 plot the `r nrow(filter(designStatus,IR2018 == '2018'))` stations sampled from `r IRrange` with major river basins and US Level III Ecoregions, respectively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of percent river miles not meeting water quality criteria or established screening values are reported with 95% confidence intervals using a local area variance estimator statistical technique. The sampling frame provided by USEPA for Virginia streams and rivers includes 49,100 miles.  It is important to note that the total amount of assessed river miles may vary to some extent by parameter.  This number varies based on whether a monitoring tool was appropriate for the sampling location.  For example, VDEQ biological monitoring tools are not validated for streams without a defined channel, thus streams dominated by wetlands cannot be assessed (approximately 5,000 miles).  The actual number of target stream miles (perennial, flowing freshwater) is much less because several thousands of stream miles are not perennial (e.g. the stream was dry when VDEQ visited) or were found to be saltwater influenced. There is an estimated 1,200 miles of non-wadeable streams (also referred to as boatable sites), which must be sampled using large river habitat and biological sampling methods. Non-wadeable and wadeable sites, and associated watersheds, sampled since 2001 are presented in Figure 2.4-6. Large river data collection, using a non-wadeable (boatable) methodology, is underway and the condition will be included in future 303(d) / 305(b) Integrated Report chapters. The ProbMon chapter provides estimates for all perennial, non-tidal, wadeable stream and river miles which equates to approximately 41,500 miles.

### 2.4.3 Parameters with Water Quality Standards or Screening Values

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, metals (dissolved and sediment), organic chemicals, and bacteria have applicable water quality criteria or screening values.  Water quality standards are regulatory thresholds developed to protect water quality conditions in support of swimming, fishing, and aquatic life designated uses. Screening values are non-regulatory thresholds used to interpret select water quality parameters. Overall results are summarized in Figure 2.4-1 and individual parameter results are discussed below. 

#### Dissolved Oxygen

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the most important measures of water quality for aquatic organisms.  Adequate DO is a fundamental physiological requirement for aquatic life.  In streams, the DO concentration may be altered by photosynthesis, respiration, nutrient input, re-aeration, and temperature, all of which have seasonal and daily cycles.  This natural variability is reflected in the stream classification component of Virginia’s Water Quality Standards (9 VAC 25-260, Commonwealth of Virginia 2017).  For example, a mountain stream that supports native trout is expected to have higher DO than a low-gradient, warm water stream.  Although expectations for DO concentration vary, all waters (excluding swamps) in Virginia are required to have a DO concentration of 4 mg/L or above.  DO standards can be determined on a case-by-case basis if DO deviates due to natural conditions as in swamps and other wetlands (Commonwealth of Virginia 2017).  Pollution plays an important role in dissolved oxygen concentration.  Human and animal wastes released into streams provide nutrients which cause excessive growth of algae and aquatic plants.  As microbes break down this organic matter, their respiration can deplete the available DO and the aquatic biota may become stressed and die due to low DO concentration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProbMon results indicate that DO conditions for the majority of Virginia’s streams and rivers are above the minimum value of 4 mg/L (Table 2.4-1). Most stations with values below 4 mg/L are located in coastal ecoregions where the DO is naturally lower due to swamp conditions. These sites with low DO need to be reviewed as candidates for site specific DO standards. ProbMon results suggest that the majority of mountainous zone waters, stockable trout waters, and natural trout waters are meeting DO standards. Estimates are reflective of two sampling events from all perennial wadeable systems.

knitr::kable(DOsummary,align='c')
```


#### pH

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another primary parameter used to evaluate water quality is pH.  pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in water or the amount of acidity present.  Since the pH scale is logarithmic to base 10, a decline in pH by one unit indicates a tenfold decrease in hydrogen ions.  At pH 7, a solution is neutral whereas pH values below 7 indicate acidic conditions and values above 7 indicate basic conditions.
  	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stream pH depends on local geology, ecology, and anthropogenic influences. If a stream has poor buffering capacity as is the case for a stream flowing over granite or shale, it may be naturally acidic.  In the case where inorganic acids such as sulfuric or nitric acid are introduced via rain, the low buffering capacity can be rapidly exhausted and the pH declines.  The resulting low pH may be detrimental to aquatic biota unaccustomed to low pH.  pH values harmful to aquatic life are below 6 or above 9.  This range is reflected in Virginia’s Water Quality Standards, where most waters must fall within a pH range of between 6 and 9. Natural pH values of 5 or below occur in swamp waters and should not be considered harmful to the native fauna common to those ecosystems.  pH standards can be determined on a case-by-case basis if pH deviates due to natural conditions as in swamps and other wetlands (Commonwealth of Virginia 2017). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProbMon results show that `r format(filter(paramsummary,Parameter=='pH\n(Below 6)')$pct,digits=1,nsmall=1)`% of wadeable Virginia streams and rivers are estimated to have pH below 6 (Table 2.4-2). All stations with deviations in pH occurred at sites located in the coastal ecoregion where swamp waters are common, which indicates the need to continue revising site specific water quality standards. VDEQ collects additional parameters, including Acid Neutralizing Capacity (ANC) and sulfate data at ProbMon stations to estimate the percent of streams impacted by acid rain and acid mine drainage. High sulfate values in low pH streams are indicative of acid mine drainage whereas streams with low ANC values are susceptible to episodic acidification from acid rain runoff (USEPA 2000).  However, based on ProbMon data collected during the `r IRyear` assessment period, DEQ estimates that no pH values are below 6 in the mountain ecoregions. Estimates are reflective of an average of two data points, where data are available.

##### Table 2.4-2.  pH results (`r IRrange`, n=`r max(filter(dat,Subpopulation=='IR2018'&Indicator=='pH')$NResp)`) of streams below or above Virginia’s Water Quality Standard ( +/- confidence limits).
```{r}
knitr::kable(pHsummary,align='c')
```


#### Temperature

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature affects water quality by potentially imposing a heat burden on aquatic life and by limiting the level of dissolved oxygen in water. Temperature in streams varies in relation to seasonal and daily changes.  Sunlight is the primary source of temperature change.  Stream temperature is also influenced by the temperature of the stream bed, groundwater inputs, and air in contact with the water surface. Temperature is inversely related to bank vegetation cover as less cover results in more exposure to the sun and higher instream temperatures. Also, runoff from impervious surfaces in urban areas may increase water temperature.  Finally, effluent that is discharged to a waterbody tends to have higher temperature than the receiving stream and may elevate instream water temperature. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stream temperature has a significant effect on aquatic organisms.  It can directly influence the types of organisms found in an aquatic system as well as their growth, behavior, metabolism, reproduction and feeding habits. Virginia’s temperature standards reflect the upper limit for the support of different forms of aquatic life (Commonwealth of Virginia 2017).  Standards for temperature vary, notably in cold water fisheries, but as a general rule, all waters in Virginia are required to have a temperature at or below 31 or 32 degrees Celsius.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, VDEQ estimates that temperature violations will be rare in Virginia’s wadeable streams (Table 2.4-3) during the spring and fall. However, it is important to note that ProbMon temperature data is seldom collected during the most stressful hydrologic and weather conditions. Estimates are reflective of an average of two data points, where data are available. In order to properly estimate temperature problems, temperature data must be collected continuously. Continuous temperature data collection began in 2016 at twenty probabilistic trend sites.

```

#### Dissolved Metals

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy metals have been identified as an important influence on benthic community structure in streams (Clements et al. 2000).  Some taxa appear to be relatively tolerant to metals while other taxa are intolerant of heavy metals.  Metals are most biologically available and toxic when dissolved in water.  Toxicity of many metals is dependent on water hardness making it necessary to calculate site specific water quality criteria from hardness values.  Table 2.4-4 lists the Virginia Water Quality Criteria for metals assuming a hardness (expressed as CaCO~3~) of 100 mg/L for most dissolved metals.  The table also summarizes the number of sites that had detectable analytical results and the number of criterion exceedances based on site specific hardness values.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All criteria are calculated using site-specific hardness measures. No samples were measured above their respective chronic or acute sample criteria during the `r IRyear` Integrated Report sample window (`r IRrange`). Results are shown in Table 2.4-4.

names(x) <- c('Metal','VDEQ Acute Criteria (ppb^1^)','VDEQ Chronic Criteria (ppb^1^)','# Above Criteria','% of Miles Above Criteria')
knitr::kable(x,align='c')
```


#### Sediment Metals

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VDEQ collected 492 sediment metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc) samples from 2001 through 2012 and reported results in the 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 Integrated Reports. Sediment metals concentrations were below Probable Effects Concentrations (PECs) and affected a low percentage of stream miles. Due to the low prevalence of metals above PECs in Virginia’s wadeable streams and high sampling costs, VDEQ has suspended sediment metals sampling.  Consequently, VDEQ will not report on sediment in the `r IRyear` assessment cycle. Integrated Report chapters from previous assessment cycles contain estimates of sediment metals in sediment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These chapters can be accessed at: http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Programs/Water/WaterQualityInformationTMDLs/WaterQualityMonitoring/ProbabilisticMonitoring.aspx#reports .


#### Organic Chemicals in Sediment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001 and 2002, VDEQ collected organic chemicals, organic pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, semi-volatile constituents, and herbicides in sediment but the data were not analyzed at a low enough detection limit to provide useful information. VDEQ collected 209 organic chemical samples (total PCB, total PAH, heptachlor, chlordane, dieldrin, lindane, endrin, DDT, DDD, DDE, Total DDT, anthracene, chrysene, fluoranthene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benzoanthracene, benzo-a-pyrene) in sediment samples from 2003 through 2006 and reported results in the 2008 and 2010 Integrated Reports Probabilistic Monitoring chapters. A low percentage of wadeable stream miles had concentrations above PECs. Due to high sampling costs, VDEQ will not report on organic chemicals during this assessment cycle. Integrated report chapters from previous assessment cycles contain estimates of organic chemicals in sediment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These chapters can be found online at: http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Programs/Water/WaterQualityInformationTMDLs/WaterQualityMonitoring/ProbabilisticMonitoring.aspx#reports.


#### Bacteria

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) bacteria are found in the intestines and fecal matter of warm-blooded animals.  High counts of *E. coli* bacteria in a stream indicate that there is an elevated risk of illness from pathogenic organisms.  According to Virginia’s Water Quality Standard for *E. coli*, a stream should not exceed a geometric mean (for two or more samples taken within a calendar month) of 126 colony forming units (cfu) per 100mL of water or an instantaneous maximum of 235 cfu/100mL (Commonwealth of Virginia 2017).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VDEQ bacterial impairment listing is determined based on a temporal data set where bimonthly bacteria samples are collected from a single site over two years. Bacteria are only sampled once at each ProbMon site.  Site specific bacteria problems are best characterized by repeated samples over several months as is the approach in VDEQ’s ambient monitoring program. For this reason, bacteria results from the freshwater ProbMon program and ambient monitoring program are not comparable and as such the results are not presented. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in 2013, VDEQ sampled bacteria monthly at probabilistic monitoring sites that met certain criteria. Monthly sampling efforts will allow VDEQ to make temporally accurate bacteria estimates, which will be included in future reports.


### 2.4.4 Biological Monitoring

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biological monitoring, or biomonitoring, of streams and rivers is an integral component of VDEQ’s water quality monitoring program.  Biomonitoring allows VDEQ to assess the overall ecological condition of streams and rivers by evaluating stream condition with respect to suitability for support of aquatic communities. In Virginia, benthic macroinvertebrate communities are used as indicators of ecological condition and to address the question of whether a waterbody supports the aquatic life designated use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VDEQ uses multimetric macroinvertebrate indices, specifically the Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) and the Virginia Coastal Plain Macroinvertebrate Index (VCPMI), to assess the aquatic life use status of wadeable streams and rivers.  The VSCI and the VCPMI are applied to biomonitoring data collected in freshwater non-coastal areas and freshwater coastal areas, respectively. These indices utilize several biological metrics that are regionally calibrated to the appropriate reference condition (VDEQa 2006; VDEQ 2013).  Results are calculated into a single value, or score, that is sensitive to a wide range of stressors.  

##### Table 2.4-5. VSCI/CPMI (`r IRrange`, n=`r max(filter(dat,Subpopulation=='IR2018'&Indicator=='VSCIVCPMI')$NResp)`) Scores below Virginia’s Assessment Thresholds ( +/- confidence limits).
```{r}
VSCIsummary <- data.frame(Parameter='VSCI/VCPMI',pct=vlookup(60,VSCI,2,TRUE),
                          ErrorLCB95=c(vlookup(60,VSCI,2,TRUE)-vlookup(60,VSCI,3,TRUE)),
                          ErrorUCB95=c(vlookup(60,VSCI,4,TRUE)-vlookup(60,VSCI,2,TRUE)))%>%
  mutate(Parameter='VSCI/VCPMI',
         Below=paste(format(pct,digits=2,nsmall=1),'% (+/- ',
                     format(ErrorLCB95,digits=2,nsmall=1),'% )',sep=''))%>%
  select(Parameter,Below)
names(VSCIsummary) <- c('Parameter','Percentage of Stream Miles Below Standard (+/- Confidence Limits)')

knitr::kable(VSCIsummary,align='c')
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VSCI and VCPMI scores were scaled for comparability in all analyses. Based on VSCI and VCPMI ProbMon results, VADEQ estimates that `r format(vlookup(60,VSCI,2,T),digits=1,nsmall=1)`% of Virginia streams and rivers do not meet the aquatic life use standard (Table 2.4-5, VDEQ 2018). An estimate of statewide biological health by condition category is shown in Figure 2.4-7. VSCI scores less than 42 are considered severely ecologically stressed, scores between 42 and 60 are moderately stressed, while sites above 60 to 72 are thought to have good ecological condition and sites with VSCI scores above 72 are considered to have excellent water quality and habitat conditions  (VDEQ, 2006a). It is important to remember that biological indicators represent long-term water quality conditions and respond to a variety of stressors.

#### Statewide Status

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection of probabilistic monitoring data from 2001 to `r IRyearWindowEnd` has generated a robust dataset with enough samples to analyze differences in biological condition by stream size, ecoregion, and major basins. The 2018 Integraged Report `r ifelse(IRyearWindowEnd == 2016, 'is','was')` the first time the Probabilistic Monitoring program has had enough data to perform analyses of statewide status of biological condition. Previously, certain major river basins did not have enough samples to extrapolate an estimate of biological condition. Estimates may be calculated on datasets with more than 30 samples (Feller 1968) and due to the random basis of the probabilistic sampling frame, it has taken sixteen years to produce enough data in certain basins to meet those analytical requirements. Ongoing data collection will continue to reduce the variability around estimates of biological condition. The  below analyses utilize the probabilistic monitoring dataset from 2001 to `r IRyearWindowEnd` to illustrate the current status of Virginia waterways across various environmental classifications. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in biological community are evident by grouping streams based on their size. For this analysis, streams were categorized as small, medium, and large based on the qualifications listed in Table 2.4-6. Figure 2.4-8 uses this stream size classification to compare percent of stream miles at or below the biological stream condition assessment threshold. Nearly half of all small and medium streams have moderately to severely stressed biological conditions. Large streams are significantly different relative to their smaller counterparts with just under a quarter of large wadeable stream miles falling below the biological assessment threshold. This may suggest that larger streams have benefited from point source pollution controls, which are more common in larger watersheds, while smaller streams are adversely impacted by nonpoint source pollution. Nonpoint source pollution is more difficult to control due to its dispersed nature and is prevalent in both small and large streams. 

##### Table 2.4-6 Stream size categories.
```{r}
sizeorder <- data.frame(x=c('Small','Medium','Large'),y=c('1,2,3','2,3,4','3,4,5'),z=c('< 10','10 - 50','> 50'))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluating biological condition by EPA Level III Ecoregions offers a different lens to analyze Virginia streams, grouping Virginia's diverse geography based on similarities among environmental resources (Omernik 1987). Ecoregions are based on many factors including land use, land surface form, potential natural vegetation, and soils. An ecoregion is useful at the state level to understand the attainable ranges of aquatic ecosystems. Figure 2.4-9 illustrates percent of stream miles below the biological assessment threshold by Virginia ecoregions. The Central Appalachians have the highest percentage of stream miles that are considered moderately to severely stressed biologically. The Blue Ridge Mountains maintain the highest quality biologically and are significantly different than all other ecoregions in terms of stream miles below the biologic threshold. The Blue Ridge Mountains are known for dense, protected forests while the Central Appalachians have experienced a high degree of resource extraction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biological condition by major basins is first presented in a bar chart similar to graphics previously discussed. Figure 2.4-10 illustrates the differences in biological condition across Virginia basins as the percent of river miles below the biologic assessment threshold. Four of eleven major basins in Virginia have well over 50% of stream miles under moderate to severe biological stress, including the Big Sandy, Chowan, Rappahannock, and Shenandoah. Most of the major basins have between 25 to 50% of stream miles below the biological standard. The Holston basin has the fewest stream miles with moderate to severe biological stress at only `r format(filter(basintrend,basin=='Holston')$VSCIpct,digits=2,nsmall=1)`%.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micromaps are employed in this chapter to visualize this spatially distributed dataset. Micromaps illustrate statistics while highlighting geographic regions from which they are derived. Figure 2.4-11 offers a simplistic micromap, identifying VSCI/VCPMI by basin for explanatory purposes. By using a micromap and plotting the median VSCI/VCPMI and interquartile range, we can visualize the range of biological condition in each major basin as well as compare these statistics among basins.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand Figure 2.4-11, begin at the top panel where the James, Holston, New, and Clinch-Powell basins are highlighted. Moving from left to right, the n column specifies how many samples were collected in each basin. The number of samples per basin is consistent across all micromaps presented in this chapter. The dotplot identifies the median VSCI/VCPMI score in each basin  with a solitary dot and the interquartile range, a measure of variability in the dataset between the 25th and 75th percentile, illustrated by a horizontal line spanning these percentiles. The dashed vertical line at 60 highlights the threshold for biological impairment. On the far right, a map illustrates which basins are described statistically in that panel with colors corresponding to the dot left of the basin name. Basins are grayed out in lower maps to indicate they are highlighted in a map above. Because the basins are ordered by median VSCI/VCPMI scores, basins at the top of the micromap have the best biological condition and basins at the bottom have the worst. The micromap illustrates the Chowan, Big Sandy, and Rappahannock generally have the lowest median VSCI/VCPMI scores in the state. Another interesting takeaway is the differences in the sub basins that make up the Tennessee drainage.  The Holston plots at nearly the opposite end of the biological condition scale in comparison to the Big Sandy.

### 2.4.5 Parameters without Water Quality Standards

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stressors that increase the risk to benthic macroinvertebrate communities and do not have specific water quality standards include streambed sedimentation, habitat degradation, nutrients, ionic strength, and water column cumulative metals. Thresholds for the aforementioned stressors are presented in Tables 2.4-7 and 2.4-8 and are derived from literature values. The ‘optimal’ classification represents water quality conditions that are not associated with degraded aquatic communities. Stressors classified as ‘suboptimal’ increase the likelihood of finding an impacted aquatic community. The condition class between optimal and suboptimal is termed ‘fair’ as the stress to the aquatic community is less certain.

bioindicators <- data.frame(resp=c('Virginia Stream Condition Index','Virginia Coastal Plain Macoinvertebrate Index'),optimal=c('> 60','> 40'),Suboptimal=c('<50','<30'),classref=c('(VDEQ 2006a)','(VDEQ 2013)'))

[^1]:The screening values presented in Table 2.4-8 do not represent water quality criteria nor are intended for establishing TMDL endpoints. The values represent an increase in the probability of stress to benthic communities as described in section 2.4.6 (Relative Risk). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following examples, water quality parameters without regulatory standards or criteria are presented using barplots and micromaps. The barplots represent estimates drawn from data in the `r IRyear` Integrated Report sample window (`r IRrange`). The micromaps utilize data from the entire probabilistic monitoring dataset (2001 - `r IRyearWindowEnd`) in order to present parameter estimates that are representative at a basin-specific scale. Thus, Virginia stream mile estimates are not identical between the micromap and barplot examples. The micromaps intend to highlight the extent to which certain stressors without standards affect major basins across Virginia as well as the extent of stream miles categorized as suboptimal by distinct stressors. Because the same scale (percent of stream miles) is utilized across all of the following micromaps, one can efficiently compare the degree to which different parameters influence the percent of suboptimal stream miles across Virginia's river basins.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biological information presented in the micromap beside each non regulated parameter does not seek to explain the impact any one parameter imparts on a particular river basin. Moreover, micromaps aid in visualization of individual stressors alongside biological condition such that stressors that impart a stronger influence on aquatic life relative to others may be more readily identified. For instance, a basin with a low percentage of stream miles with suboptimal total phosphorus may not have a similarly low percentage of stream miles below the VSCI/VCPMI assessment threshold. The biological community, and thus the VSCI/VCPMI scores, record the impacts of a multitude of stressors to the community and can often confound direct correlation of individual stressors to biological condition. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously mentioned, utilizing micromaps to visualize individual stressors alongside biological condition helps identify stressors that impart a stronger influence on aquatic life relative to others. To accentuate these storylines, a system of ranking basins based on the percent of stream miles that fall into the suboptimal category for each non regulated parameter is utilized. Accordingly, a basin with the highest rank (1) will have the most suboptimal stream miles for a particular stressor while a basin with the lowest rank (11) will have the least suboptimal stream miles for that respective parameter. Fewer suboptimal stream miles indicate a particular stressor does not have a widespread influence within a particular basin. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the section, these results are summarized with a heatmap (Figure 2.4-24) that highlights the highest ranking basins for each stressor using darker colors. As the ranking decreases, indicating fewer suboptimal stream miles, the corresponding color shade lightens. Utilizing this schema, one can readily identify basins that are influenced by multiple stressors versus basins that have impacts from fewer stressors. The heatmap illustrates the prevalence of various unregulated stressors with respect to aquatic communities. By looking at the shading and rank assigned to each unregulated stressor in the basin column, one can visualize what stressors, or combinations of stressors may be negatively impacting aquatic communities.  

#### Habitat Disturbance

```{r}
TotHabstats <- statslookup('TotHab',120,'SubOptimal',FALSE)%>%select(-c(matchingdfname))

  mutate(Rank=1:11)
```


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habitat is defined as the area or environment where an organism resides. It encompasses its surroundings, both living and non-living. Fish, aquatic insects, and plants require certain types of habitat to thrive, so in-stream and riparian (stream bank) habitat is evaluated when a biomonitoring sample is collected. Because different organisms have diverse habitat requirements, a variety of available habitat types in a stream or river will support a diverse aquatic community. Habitat is scored by evaluating ten habitat parameters and adding them together (total scores range from 0 to 200). Habitat scores above 150 indicate habitat conditions favorable for supporting a healthy aquatic community and are considered optimal. Scores lower than 120 are considered suboptimal and scores between 120 and 150 are fair (EPA 1999). As indicated in Figure 2.4-12, VDEQ estimates that slightly over `r format(100-vlookup(150,hab,2,TRUE),digits=2,nsmall=0)`% of stream and river miles have available habitat that is considered optimal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2.4-13 utilizes micromaps to depict the prevalence and scale of habitat disturbance across major basins statewide. The left barplot highlights the estimated percent of stream miles with suboptimal habitat scores, ordered from highest to lowest, with the corresponding statewide estimate of stream miles with suboptimal habitat scores (`r format(filter(TotHabstats,Subpopulation=='Virginia')$TotHabEstimate.P,digits=2,nsmall=1)`%) illustrated with a vertical dashed line. The right barplot shows the percent of stream miles below the biological impairment threshold for each basin, again with the Virginia estimate of stream miles below the biological impairment threshold represented by a dashed vertical line (`r format(filter(VSCIstats,Subpopulation=='Virginia')$VSCIVCPMIEstimate.P,digits=2,nsmall=1)`%). No distinct spatial relationship appears when analyzing habitat disturbance with micromaps, indicating habitat degradation is a widespread problem across Virginia and not limited to particular watersheds or areas in the state. By ranking major watersheds by decreasing estimates of habitat alteration, the Rappahannock, Chowan, New, Clinch-Powell, and Roanoke have suboptimal habitat condition exceeding the statewide estimate.

From left to right, the vertical dashed lines represent the percent of stream miles across Virginia with suboptimal habitat disturbance and biologic condition below the assessment threshold, respectively.

#### Streambed Sedimentation

```


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive sedimentation is a component of habitat and is one of the most pronounced impacts to benthic communities. Excess sediment fills interstitial spaces in the stream substrates used by aquatic organisms, disturbs refuge areas, and can potentially smother the organisms. Until recently, tools for quantifying sedimentation impacts in streams have been inadequate. Methods existed for describing dominant instream particle size, but it was difficult to differentiate between natural conditions and man-made problems.  Virginia has a variety of stream types; many are naturally sand/silt bed streams, so simply measuring the size of the sediment particles cannot differentiate natural and human-influenced sediment load.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VDEQ uses the relative bed stability (RBS) method for predicting the expected substrate size distribution for streams (Kaufmann 1999).  RBS incorporates stream channel shape, slope, flow, and sediment supply.  The method calculates a ‘stream power’ based on channel measurements to predict the expected sediment size distribution. The ratio of the observed sediment to the expected sediment is a measure of the RBS. A stream with a log RBS of less than -1 is carrying excess sediment while streams between -0.5 and 0.5 have a normal sediment load (Kaufmann 1999 and USEPA 2000). Over `r format(vlookup(-1,LRBS,2,TRUE),digits=2,nsmall=0)`% of Virginia’s stream and river miles have suboptimal sedimentation values (Figure 2.4-14).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2.4-15 illustrates the extent of stream miles affected by excess sedimentation is more prevalent in each of the major basins compared to overall habitat condition. All basins are estimated to have at least 8% of stream miles with suboptimal sedimentation levels. The Chowan, Roanoke, and New are estimated to have more stream miles with suboptimal sedimentation levels than the overall estimate for stream miles in the Commonwealth (`r format(filter(LRBSstats,Subpopulation=='Virginia')$LRBSEstimate.P,digits=2,nsmall=0)`%). The basins with the highest percent of stream miles with suboptimal sedimentation are among the basins with the highest percent of stream miles below the VSCI/VCPMI assessment threshold. The micromap identifies the Big Sandy and Shenandoah basins are below the statewide average for suboptimal streambed sedimentation but above the statewide average for benthic impaired stream miles. These basins are likely affected by other stressors in addition to streambed sedimentation, resulting in the percentage of stream miles with poor biological condition above the statewide estimate. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Potomac basin has the lowest percentage of suboptimal stream miles for sedimentation, the estimate may not be fully reflective of sedimentation status in the basin. The Potomac has a high prevalence of samples with LRBS scores above 0.5, indicating hardened stream bottoms likely due to hydrologic alteration. As such, the Potomac may appear artificially stable due to more samples falling into the fair category (LRBS > 0.5) in comparison to other basins in Virginia.

From left to right, the vertical dashed lines represent the statewide percent of stream miles across Virginia with suboptimal streambed sedimentation and biologic condition below the assessment threshold, respectively.

#### Nutrients

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nutrients are substances assimilated by living organisms that promote growth. Nitrogen and  phosphorus are the two most important nutrients in Virginia streams and rivers. Excess nutrients can stimulate in-stream plant and algal growth. Characteristics of nutrient enriched streams may include low dissolved oxygen, frequent fish kills, shifts in aquatic communities, and blooms of nuisance algae. Nutrients may come from fertilized lawns and cropland, failing septic systems, municipal and industrial discharges, and/or livestock manure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total phosphorus above 0.05 mg/L and total nitrogen above 2 mg/L is considered suboptimal (Table 2.4-8) and can result in undesirable algae growth and shifts in aquatic communities (VDEQ 2006a). VDEQ estimates that only `r format(vlookup(0.02,TP,2,TRUE),digits=2,nsmall=0)`% of streams and river miles are classified as optimal for total phosphorus while over `r format(vlookup(1,TN,2,TRUE),digits=2,nsmall=0)`% of stream and river miles are considered optimal for total nitrogen (Figures 2.4-16 and 2.4-17).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using micromaps to analyze nutrients by basin clearly highlights spatial relationships in the dataset. Figure 2.4-18 ranks basins by percent of stream miles that fall into the suboptimal total phosphorus category (> 0.05 mg/L). The associated percent of stream miles below the biologic assessment threshold follows in the rightmost plot. The vertical lines on each barplot indicate the percent of stream miles throughout Virginia that fall into the suboptimal category for total phosphorus and below the biological impairment threshold, `r format(filter(TPall,Subpopulation=='Virginia')$TPEstimate.P,digits=2,nsmall=0)`% and `r format(filter(TPall,Subpopulation=='Virginia')$VSCIVCPMIEstimate.P,digits=2,nsmall=0)`%, respectively). The micromap readily displays the percent of stream miles deemed suboptimal due to total phosphorus decreases from east to west across the state. Basins with higher percentages of suboptimal stream miles due to phosphorus are associated with higher percentages of stream miles below the biological assessment threshold. However, the percent of stream miles below the biological threshold cannot be attributed to one parameter, as evident by the very low number of suboptimal total phosphorus stream miles in the Big Sandy basin yet a high percent of suboptimal VSCI/VCPMI stream miles. Note that the percentage of suboptimal stream miles for total phosphorus are the same for both Big Sandy and Clinch-Powell, producing a tied rank of 10.

From left to right, the vertical dashed lines represent the percent of stream miles across Virginia with suboptimal total phosphorus and VSCI/VCPMI below the assessment threshold, respectively.

```


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionic strength varies with natural geology, but increases significantly in response to anthropogenic activities such as surface mining, road salts, or other industrial discharges. VDEQ uses total dissolved solids (TDS) to measure ionic strength. Ionic strength is a measure of dissolved ions, dissolved metals, minerals, and organic matter in the water column. Water quality studies have consistently demonstrated that high levels of TDS in the water column impact aquatic life (VDEQ 2006b). TDS levels above 350 mg/L increase the likelihood of having a degraded aquatic community and are considered suboptimal (Table 2.4-8). Results are shown in Figure 2.4-20; VDEQ estimates that about `r format(100-vlookup(350,TDS,2,TRUE),digits=1,nsmall=0)`% of Virginia streams have TDS levels in the suboptimal range.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A micromap offers a unique visualization tool to distinguish spatial trends in ionic strength across Virginia (Figure 2.4-21). The southwest corner of Virginia, where resource extraction has traditionally occurred, boasts the highest percentages of stream miles with suboptimal total dissolved solids. These basins include the Big Sandy, Clinch-Powell, and New. Additional basins above the Virginia estimate for stream miles with suboptimal total dissolved solids (`r format(filter(TDSall,Subpopulation=='Virginia')$TDSEstimate.P,digits=2)`%) are the Potomac and Shenandoah basins. These basins drain areas of the state with concentrated population centers where urban run-off and industrial processes could be contributing to higher instream ionic strength (Paul & Meyer 2001). Stream miles with suboptimal total dissolved solids are not widespread statewide and in the majority of basins do not appear to be a major driver for the percentage of stream miles below the biological threshold.

From left to right, the vertical dashed lines represent the percent of stream miles across Virginia with suboptimal total dissolved solids and moderately to severely stressed biological communities, respectively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy metals such as mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, and lead in streams and rivers can be harmful to aquatic insects at low concentrations. The metals tend to accumulate in the gills and muscles of aquatic organisms. Dissolved metals have been identified as important predictors of stream health. Toxicity of many metals is dependent on water hardness, making it necessary to calculate site specific water quality criteria from hardness values. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of water quality criteria, dissolved metals are typically treated independently (as discussed in Section 2.4.3); however, there is strong evidence that metals have a cumulative effect (Clements 2000).  Cumulative Criterion Units (CCU) account for this additive effect by standardizing each dissolved metal’s concentration. The metals are summed together and the result is the CCU Metals Index score. When the CCU Metals Index is above 2, the cumulative effect is considered likely to harm aquatic life (Clements 2000). VDEQ estimates that nearly `r format(100-vlookup(2,mCCU,2,TRUE),digits=1)`% of river miles in Virginia have Cumulative Criterion Units that are considered suboptimal (Figure 2.4-22; Table 2.4-8).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved metals are not a widespread issue affecting many major basins across Virginia (Figure 2.4-23). The Rappahannock, Chowan, and York basins all demonstrate estimates of stream miles with suboptimal water column metals levels above the Virginia estimate (`r format(filter(MCCUall,Subpopulation=='Virginia')$MetalCCUEstimate.P,digits=1,nsmall=1)`%). The majority of basins in Virginia do not have any stream miles that fall into the suboptimal category for water column metals. Because the majority of stream miles in the Commonwealth do not have excess water column metal concentrations, those stream miles below the VSCI/VCPMI assessment threshold are due to negative impacts from other water quality parameters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2.4-24 combines the basin ranks from the previous micromaps to summarize the percent of stream miles that are suboptimal for each of the respective non-regulated parameters relative to the VSCI/VCPMI. Basins were ranked from one (1) to eleven (11) for each parameter, with a rank of 1 corresponding to the basin with the most stream miles in the suboptimal range and a rank of 11 where the fewest stream miles fall into the suboptimal range. The summary heatmap graphic is also color coded by rank, scaling from dark red to white as the percentage of suboptimal stream miles decreases from the highest to the lowest rank. Basins with the darkest boxes have the highest percentage of suboptimal stream miles due to the parameters listed in the left column. As evident by the numeric and color ranks, the Rappahannock and Chowan have the most stream miles impacted by multiple non-regulated parameters. These basins are heavily stressed by a number of water quality parameters that do not have Water Quality Standards. The James basin contains the fewest stream miles (e.g. ranks the lowest) considered suboptimal for parameters without Water Quality Standards.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ranking basins from 1 to 11 according to the percent of stream miles that are below the assessment impairment threshold (VSCI/VCPMI = 60), Figure 2.4-24 ranks the Big Sandy, Chowan, and Rappahannock highest (rank 1, 2, and 3,  respectively) and the Holston, James, and Clinch-Powell lowest (rank 11 and 10, and 9, respectively). The Rappahannock and Chowan hold the top three ranks for four of the parameters without Water Quality Standards detailed in this report. Interestingly, the Big Sandy is ranked in the top three for one parameter, ionic strength, while the Shenandoah (4th ranking for suboptimal stream miles below the VSCI/VCPMI threshold) is ranked 1 for total nitrogen. These differences in the number and type of parameters that may be driving the negative impacts on streams in each basin are worth noting. Multiple parameters without Water Quality Standards may be driving the higher percentage of stream miles falling below the biological assessment threshold in the Chowan and Rappahannock basins. This complex situation may present management challenges with efforts to improve aquatic health. However, basins with fewer high ranking parameters without applicable criteria, like ionic strength in the Big Sandy and total nitrogen in the Shenandoah, present opportunities where management efforts focused on single parameters may generate improvements to aquatic health on a basin-wide scale.

### 2.4.6 Stressor Extent and Relative Risks 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the advantages of probabilistic datasets are the ability to calculate the stressor extent (Figure 2.4-25, Figure 2.4-27) and relative risks (Figure 2.4-26) that different environmental stressors have on the ecological health of rivers and streams across large regions. Since the stations are selected at random, VDEQ can estimate water quality parameter values over the entire state with known confidence. USEPA and other states have employed stressor extent and relative risk concepts extensively in their reports (ODEQ 2007; USEPA 2006; Van Sickle 2006; Van Sickle 2008).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stressor extent shows how prevalent a stressor is in Virginia streams. Calculation of relative risk requires classification of water quality responses (e.g. the benthic macroinvertebrate indices – Table 2.4-7) and the water quality stressors (Table 2.4-8) into optimal and suboptimal categories.  VDEQ classified biological response parameters based on the aquatic life use standard.  The stressor indicators in Table 2.4-8 were classified using screening values from peer reviewed literature studies. It is important to remember that the stressor screening values are not equivalent to water quality standards in the Commonwealth of Virginia. This data-intensive statistical technique requires the entire probabilistic monitoring dataset (2001 - `r IRyearWindowEnd`).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative risk is a term borrowed from the medical field and applied here to communicate the potential impact a stressor has on the aquatic environment. For example, it has been shown that an individual with total cholesterol above 240 mg/dl is at greater risk for heart disease than an individual whose cholesterol is below 200 mg/dl.  When an individual has a cholesterol level above 240, their relative risk of having heart disease is higher than an individual with cholesterol level below 200. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative risks for aquatic stressors can be interpreted in a similar manner to the heart disease example. Figure 2.4-26 illustrates that the relative risk to the biological community due to habitat disturbance is `r format(filter(rr,Stressor=='Habitat Disturbance')$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)`; thus, the biological community is `r format(filter(rr,Stressor=='Habitat Disturbance')$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)` times more likely to be considered suboptimal when habitat disturbance scores are below 120 (USEPA 1999).  Relative risk values larger than 1 indicate an elevated risk to the biological community; consequently, only water quality stressors with a relative risk greater than 1 are reported in this chapter. pH was also evaluated for increased risk to the biological community but did not show significant relative risk to the biological community.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common stressor across Virginia is `r tolower(as.character(arrange(stressorext ,desc(pct))$Parameter[1]))`. ProbMon data estimates `r tolower(as.character(arrange(stressorext ,desc(pct))$Parameter[1]))` is considered suboptimal in almost `r format(arrange(stressorext ,desc(pct))$pct[1],digits=1,nsmall=0)`% of Virginia streams.  When `r tolower(as.character(arrange(stressorext ,desc(pct))$Parameter[1]))` levels are suboptimal, relative risk analysis predicts they are `r format(filter(rr,Stressor==as.character(arrange(stressorext ,desc(pct))$Parameter[1]))$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)` times more likely to have a suboptimal benthic community than streams with optimal sedimentation levels. Nearly `r format(filter(stressorext,Parameter=='Habitat Disturbance')$pct,digits=1,nsmall=0)`% of Virginia streams have suboptimal habitat disturbance scores; suboptimal habitat disturbance scores increase the relative risk of a suboptimal aquatic community by a factor of `r format(filter(rr,Stressor=='Habitat Disturbance')$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)`. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two major nutrients found in Virginia streams are nitrogen and phosphorus; their relative risks are `r format(filter(rr,Stressor=='Total Phosphorus')$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)` and `r format(filter(rr,Stressor=='Total Nitrogen')$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)`, respectively.  Suboptimal phosphorus conditions occur in many more streams (`r format(filter(stressorext,Parameter=='Total Phosphorus')$pct,digits=1,nsmall=1)`%) than elevated nitrogen (`r format(filter(stressorext,Parameter=='Total Nitrogen')$pct,digits=1,nsmall=1)`%). Ionic strength (as measured by total dissolved solids) has a relative risk of `r format(filter(rr,Stressor=='Ionic Strength')$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)` which is one of the highest relative risks in the analyses. However, suboptimal ionic strength conditions were only found in `r format(filter(stressorext,Parameter=='Ionic Strength')$pct,digits=1,nsmall=1)`% of Virginia streams. Dissolved metal concentrations that may cause adverse biological condition were found in `r format(filter(stressorext,Parameter=='Cumulative Dissolved Metals')$pct,digits=1,nsmall=1)`% of Virginia streams; however, elevated dissolved metal concentrations increase the relative risk of having a suboptimal benthic macroinvertebrate community by `r format(filter(rr,Stressor=='Cumulative Dissolved Metals')$Estimate,digits=1,nsmall=1)`. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stressor extent presented in Figure 2.4-25 only focuses on the percent of stream miles deemed suboptimal by each of the major stressors to Virginia streams. Figure 2.4-27 encompasses the entire stream population for each stressor to relate a more complete narrative surrounding stressor extents in Virginia. Streambed sedimentation has the highest extent of stress in Virginia and nearly the same percent of stream miles in the optimal and suboptimal categories. As we have explored through previous visualization tools, streambed sedimentation, total phosphorus, and habitat disturbance are fairly widespread stressors statewide.  Total nitrogen, water column metals, and ionic strength are fairly rare in Virginia with the majority of stream miles in the optimum category of their respective parameter. Dissolved oxygen and pH do not have statistically significant relative risk in Virginia, thus they are not reported. Missing form this chapter are other known stressors, such as, hydrologic alteration and temperature stress in the critical time period, due to a lack of data to produce statistically significant estimates of relative risk.

### 2.4.7 Uses of Probabilistic Data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to estimating the condition of all streams and rivers compared to established water quality criteria/screening values and identifying the major stressors to aquatic organisms, freshwater ProbMon data has many ancillary applications within water quality management programs. Examples of these uses are discussed below. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProbMon data is used in describing both the natural and baseline conditions of Virginia streams. In addition, ProbMon has helped identify minimally disturbed streams and understand their natural variability.  This information is integral for VDEQ to develop more regionally specific water quality expectations and in turn define reference conditions and select appropriate reference sites. ProbMon has also provided statistically defensible descriptions of stream conditions as of the beginning of this century. VDEQ will find this baseline tremendously valuable for comparison in future assessments.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProbMon data is currently being used by the TMDL program for stressor identification in Aquatic Life Use TMDLs (VDEQ 2017). Stressor analysis is the process whereby candidate causes of stress (or stressors) to benthic macroinvertebrate communities are evaluated. The purpose of the workgroup was to develop data collection recommendations and scientifically defensible screening values for categorizing potential stressors. ProbMon data is especially useful in describing statewide in-stream conditions for those parameters that do not currently have water quality standards. Understanding existing conditions for those parameters without water quality standards provides perspective on parameter data and a way to evaluate potential stressors. Relative Bed Stability and metals in water column cumulative criterion unit (metal CCU) are examples of new tools that are applicable to Aquatic Life TMDL stressor analysis. Relative Bed Stability is currently being utilized to evaluate sedimentation as a candidate stressor. ProbMon data was used to develop stressor specific metrics to help TMDL staff identify stressor signals from impaired reaches and collect the appropriate water chemistry information. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collocation of biological, chemical, habitat, and landuse data at ProbMon sites also allows for the examination of multiple stressors such as dissolved metal CCUs.  VDEQ plans to explore the effects of multiple stressors in future reports.  This information should aid TMDL development and provide insight into how biological communities and stressor parameters interact.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProbMon data is also being used as a test platform for new monitoring approaches such as periphyton and fish community data collection. The collection methodology was designed and tested in tandem with the USEPA’s National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS).  Until VDEQ participated in the NARS sampling, habitat and biology data collection methodologies were not refined for large rivers. Now VDEQ is collecting complete ProbMon data sets for large rivers and plans to report on the condition of this valuable freshwater resource.  Because ProbMon provides biological, chemical, physical habitat, and land use information at each site, the data set is indispensable for developing and improving biomonitoring tools. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ProbMon dataset provided crucial data needed to fill in gaps during the development of the VSCI and the validation of both the VSCI and Coastal Plain Macroinvertebrate Index (CPMI) (Maxted 2000). Following the validation, VSCI assessment results were included in the 2008 Integrated Report. VDEQ used ProbMon data to validate the CPMI. Specifically, ProbMon data was utilized to identify new reference sites in the coastal plain, check ecoregion best standard values, and select potential metrics that would help the CPMI detect benthic macroinvertebrate community stresses created by human activity. The effort resulted in a new, robust tool for evaluating benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the coastal plain regions of the Commonwealth called the Virginia Coastal Plain Macroinvertebrate Index (VCPMI, VDEQ 2013).  The technical VCPMI document is online at: http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/WaterQualityMonitoring/ProbabilisticMonitoring/vcpmi.pdf . ProbMon also aided in improving the biomonitoring program by identifying over 100 new biological references sites, doubling the number of reference sites in the Virginia reference site database. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProbMon sites are the platform for building a genus-level macroinvertebrate database which may ultimately be used in developing a more robust multimetric assessment tool. ProbMon data may also be used to create a biological condition gradient for Virginia stream and rivers. The biological condition gradient is a descriptive model that illustrates how increasing stress alters ecological attributes (Davies and Jackson 2006). A biological condition gradient defines expected conditions, like benthic macroinvertebrate community structure, for streams by stream order and ecoregion. The biological condition gradient may help VDEQ protect high-quality streams and provide stepwise interim goals for tracking water quality improvement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probabilistic data has been used to support water quality permitting decisions. VDEQ establishes defensible background conditions in dissolved metal permit model by using the statistically derived baseline metal estimates for watersheds across the Commonwealth. A workgroup has been formed to help deliver this information to the water permitting group at VDEQ.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important future application of ProbMon data is change analysis (Kincaid 2016). VDEQ adjusted the experimental design of ProbMon by adding randomly selected sentinel sites in order to accelerate its ability to detect changes in population estimates.  By revisiting a relatively small number of these randomly located sites each year, VDEQ will be able to detect statewide and regional chemical, habitat, and biological changes.  Perhaps the most important question a monitoring program addresses is: are management initiatives effective?  The ability of ProbMon to detect shifts in population estimates is critical to the goal of evaluating the effectiveness of water quality management programs.   


### 2.4.8 Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VDEQ analyzed 14 water quality parameters with established water quality criteria and/or screening values and 6 parameters without water quality criteria. Most of the parameters that have water quality criteria meet applicable standards. The majority of water quality standard exceedences are attributed to legacy pollutants or natural conditions. The results presented in the ProbMon chapter reflect the success of VDEQ’s management of water quality parameters with water quality criteria. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only biological monitoring results were found to be below screening thresholds in a relatively high percentage of streams. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities were degraded in `r format(filter(paramsummary, Parameter=='VSCI/VCPMI\n(Biomonitoring)')$pct,digits=3)`% of the wadeable streams and rivers in Virginia; a percentage that could be considered widespread. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities are indicators of water quality problems because they respond to a variety of water quality stressors including parameters that have water quality standards (e.g. dissolved oxygen levels) and parameters that do not have criteria (e.g. such as nutrients and sedimentation).  The following six stressors increase the risk to aquatic organisms and do not currently have water quality standards: streambed sedimentation, habitat disturbance, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, total dissolved solids, and cumulative metals in water column.  These parameters are discussed in Section 2.4.5. Although these six major stressors do not currently have water quality standards, most are being addressed through a variety of strategies such as nutrient management plans and best management practices.  As the ProbMon program evolves and VDEQ expands on the uses of ProbMon data, enhancement of the strategies for understanding, evaluating and restoring the Commonwealth’s streams and rivers will continue.
